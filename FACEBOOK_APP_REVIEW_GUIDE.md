## Screencast Script

### Opening (30 seconds):
```
"Hello, I'm demonstrating LeadConnector, a Facebook Lead Ads integration platform 
by SARACE DIGITALSOLUTIONS. This app helps businesses automatically capture and 
manage leads from their Facebook advertising campaigns."
```

### Login Flow (45 seconds):
```
"First, I'll show the user authentication process. Users visit our landing page 
and click 'Get Started' or 'Login'. They authenticate using Facebook OAuth, 
granting permissions to access their pages and lead data."
```

### Pages Integration (60 seconds):
```
"After login, users see their Facebook pages and can select which ones to connect. 
This uses the 'pages_show_list' permission to display their managed pages. 
When they connect a page, we subscribe to lead generation webhooks."
```

### Lead Capture Demo (90 seconds):
```
"Now I'll demonstrate live lead capture. When someone submits a lead form on 
Facebook, our webhook receives the data in real-time using the 'leads_retrieval' 
permission. The lead appears instantly in our dashboard with all field data."
```

### Analytics & Engagement (45 seconds):
```
"Finally, we show page engagement metrics using 'pages_read_engagement' permission. 
Users can track lead conversion rates, page performance, and export data to their 
existing CRM systems through webhook integrations."
```

### Closing (30 seconds):
```
"This demonstrates how LeadConnector uses Facebook permissions responsibly to 
provide valuable lead management services to business users."
```

## Permission Justifications for App Review

### 1. `pages_show_list`
**Use Case:** "Display user's Facebook pages for lead capture setup"
**Justification:**
```
This permission allows users to view and select which Facebook pages they want 
to connect for automated lead capture. The app displays a list of pages the user 
manages, enabling them to choose specific pages for lead generation integration. 
This is essential for multi-page businesses to selectively enable lead capture.
```

### 2. `leads_retrieval`
**Use Case:** "Capture and process Facebook Lead Ads data"
**Justification:**
```
This permission retrieves lead information from Facebook Lead Ads forms in real-time. 
When users run lead generation campaigns, the app captures contact information 
(name, email, phone) and custom form fields, then forwards this data to external 
CRM systems via webhooks. This enables immediate lead follow-up and improves 
business response times.
```

### 3. `pages_read_engagement`
**Use Case:** "Provide analytics and performance insights"
**Justification:**
```
This permission enables analytics features showing page engagement metrics and 
lead generation performance. Users can track lead conversion rates, campaign 
effectiveness, and page performance to optimize their Facebook advertising. 
The data helps businesses understand their lead generation ROI and make 
data-driven decisions.
```

### 4. `pages_manage_metadata`
**Use Case:** "Manage webhook subscriptions for lead capture"
**Justification:**
```
This permission allows the app to subscribe pages to leadgen webhooks automatically. 
When users connect a Facebook page, the app programmatically sets up webhook 
subscriptions to receive lead notifications. This eliminates manual configuration 
and ensures reliable lead capture setup.
```
